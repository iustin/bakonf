Welcome.

bakonf is a very simple tool designed to make backups of the
configuration files of a GNU/Linux or Unix-like system. Its aim is to
use various methods in order to reduce the size of the backup to a
reasonable minimum, in order to be useful for remote/unattended servers,
while still backing up enough to recreate the system.

The contents of the archives created contain enough information so that
the system admininistrator can restore the system to a working state.
Beside the actual information from the filesystem, the extra that bakonf
stores is (for Linux):
  - partition table
  - various /proc information
  - pci & usb device list

For other os-es, you must customize the configuration files.
